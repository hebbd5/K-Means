    "\n",
    "We'll now build from what we've done in order to develop a more robust, complete version of K-means. In this version, the code will cluster the data not twice, but as many times as necessary for the centroids to converge towards the mean of their clusters â€” or until it reaches a maximum number of iterations (N) that we'll set.\n",

    "Another important improvement from the first version is that we'll be able to use a different number of clusters (K) through the same code without being limited to splitting the dataset between only two clusters, as in lesson one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the new implementation, we'll still only work with two variables; however, we'll write more flexible code that does not rely on the variables' names, allowing the users to use any combinations of features they want to.\n",

The number of iterations in the for loop will be the maximum number of iterations performed by the algorithm.\n",
